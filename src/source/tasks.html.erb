    Each of the core protocols will be based on sociological case-studies of
    users and software projects, including other CAPS projects. The values in
    the protocols will emerge both from a systematization of the philosophy of
    the Internet (based on the work of French philosopher Bernard Stiegler) as
    well as a crowd-sourced discussion of net rights. For each protocol, there
    will be a specification that will be both formally verified for security
    properties as well as an analysis in terms of privacy, interpretation and
    scalability. These protocols will be implemented in running code and
    deployed with real users, and submitted to open standards bodies such as
    the IETF and W3C. They can then serve as the building blocks for other CAPS
    projects and wider software development.  Intensive education and outreach
    to policy-makers, developers, academics and the general public will raise
    awareness of the values of decentralisation, security, and privacy â€“ and a
    new kind of Internet.
